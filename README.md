### Analysis process and content

**Data Processing:** The article first processes the housing type data by rounding it for standardization using the "round" function. It also adds a new variable to explicitly classify the house according to the rounded integer.

**Map Analysis:** The article uses choropleth maps and heat maps to display the distribution of different indicators in specific areas. The choropleth map is used to show the distribution of income, while the heat map is used to visually display housing spots and the amount of theft.

**Correlation Analysis:** The article calculates the correlation coefficient to examine the relationship between "price" and "num_spots" (0.54), "income_pc" (0.65), and "num_theft" (0.61).

**Bar Chart Comparison:** The article uses bar charts to provide a visual comparison of these indicators and their level of excellence.

**Price Analysis:** The article mentions that based on the provided data, we can see that the price per person approximates a normal distribution of N (73.86352, 34.95557). The standard deviation is 5.9, and 73.9 + 5.9 = 79.8. Therefore, in Chicago, we can consider Airbnb prices with a per-person cost >$80 to be expensive.
